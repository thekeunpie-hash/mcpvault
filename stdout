Hi everyone,
I've been using AI Agents (specifically Antigravity) heavily for coding, but I ran into three major frustrations that I think many of you might recognize:
Infinite Loading: Without GPU, Antigravity went too slow. In my case it went 58s unresponsive per 1 min. 
Context Bloat: The agent keeps requesting the full codebase context repeatedly whenever it loads MCP's, making my MCP servers unresponsive.
Agent/UI Lag: On Windows, the agent responses kept saying "Continue" repeatedly because of 1, 2.
I couldn't find a tool that solved all of this, so I built MCP Vault (mcpv).
🔗 Repo:https://github.com/thekeunpie-hash/mcpvault (MIT Licensed)
🚀 What does it do?
It acts as a "Smart Middleware" between your Agent and your actual tools. It hijacks the mcp_config.json safely and optimizes the traffic.(All of MCPs will be kept exactly identically on C:\Users\[Username]\.gemini\antigravity\mcp_config.original.json)
1. Zero-Latency Startup (Lazy Loading) Instead of scanning files at boot, mcpv starts instantly (<0.1s). It only scans directories when the agent actually requests them. No timeouts on large repos.
2. Smart Context Valve It detects if the agent asks for a massive context dump (like a full repo summary) more than once in a session.
First request: Allowed (Full context provided).
Subsequent requests: Blocked with a "Context already cached" message (only ~20 tokens used). This physically prevents the agent from wasting tokens on duplicate data.
[System Instruction]


Session Start: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call get_initial_context tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.


Context Management: Do NOT call get_initial_context again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with force=True. The proxy will block redundant requests.


File Access: After reading the initial context map, use read_file to inspect specific files needed for the task.
This Antigravity rule needs to be added though.

3. Booster Injection (Windows/Antigravity) It auto-generates an optimized launcher script that:
Forces GPU rasterization & zero-copy flags.
Drops Admin rights (fixes drag-and-drop & UI bugs).
Kills zombie processes on port 26646 automatically.
The shortcut with injected script can be found on the desktop after installation.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python & uv: Uses uv for clean, isolated virtual environments to prevent dependency hell.
FastMCP: Built on top of the FastMCP framework for speed.
Gateway Pattern: It backs up your original config and routes traffic through the proxy securely.
📦 Installation
It's available on PyPI too.
Bash
pip install mcpv
mcpv install
Currently, it's optimized for Windows and Antigravity, but the core logic (Lazy Loading/Smart Valve) is applicable to any MCP-compliant agent.
I'd love to hear your feedback or feature requests!

## ❓ Why `mcpv`?

Have you ever felt this while using AI Agents (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Why is it so heavy?"*  
> *"It froze again..."*  
> *"Why are the token costs so high?"*

`mcpv` is not just a tool. It is a **Turbo Engine** for your agent.

<br>

### 🏎️ Overwhelming Performance Difference

| Feature | 😫 Without `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ With `mcpv` (After) | 📈 Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | No GPU, Laggy UI | **Forced GPU Acceleration, Smooth** | **100x** Perceived Speed |
| **Loading** | Wait 60s+ every time | **0.1s Instant Start** (Lazy Load) | **Zero** Latency |
| **Cost** | Resend full code every time | **Auto-block Duplicates** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Savings |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (Physical Acceleration)
**"Unlock hardware limits with one line"**
- **Forced GPU Activation**: Injects hidden rendering acceleration flags (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Permission Bypass**: Drops Admin rights to fix drag-and-drop & UI bugs, and bypasses permission requests (Error 740) using `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Zombie Process Killer**: Automatically cleans up ghost processes occupying ports.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (Cost Defense)
**"Smart wallet protector that saves for you"**
- Detects the massive context data (`repomix`) that agents habitually request.
- **First request: Allowed** (Full context provided).
- **Subsequent requests: Blocked** with a 10-token **"Already cached"** message.
- Physically blocks accidental token bombs.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (Secure Vault)
**"Stop struggling with complex configs"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: Only scans directories when the agent actually requests them. No timeouts on large repos.
- Automatically migrates existing complex MCP settings to a secure Vault.
- Original config is safely backed up to `mcp_config.original.json`.
- The agent talks only to `mcpv`, but all tools work perfectly behind the scenes.

}
```

<br>

## � Recommended System Rule

**Add this rule to your agent's system prompt (e.g., .cursorrules, .antigravityrules).**  
This ensures the agent uses `mcpv` correctly without redundant requests.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.
>
> **Context Management**: Do NOT call `get_initial_context` again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with `force=True`. The proxy will block redundant requests.
>
> **File Access**: After reading the initial context map, use `read_file` to inspect specific files needed for the task.

## �🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python & uv**: Uses `uv` for clean, isolated virtual environments to prevent dependency hell.
- **FastMCP**: Built on top of the FastMCP framework for speed.
- **Gateway Pattern**: It backs up your original config and routes traffic through the proxy securely.

<br>

---

## 📦 Installation

Choose the method that fits your needs.

### Option A: The "It Just Works" Method (Recommended for most users)
If you have Python installed and added to PATH.

```powershell
# 1. Install from PyPI
pip install mcpv

# 2. Setup Gateway & Booster
mcpv install

# 3. Done! 
# Look for the "Antigravity Boost (mcpv)" shortcut on your Desktop.

```

---

### Option B: The "Rock-Solid" Method (Using `uv`)

Use this method if your Python environment is messy or you want complete isolation.

#### 1. Clean up existing processes

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install

```powershell
# Install uv (if needed)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm [https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1](https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1) | iex"

# Create .venv and install mcpv
uv venv
uv pip install mcpv

```

#### 3. Register & Lock

This registers the **isolated virtual environment** into Antigravity's config.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force

```

#### 4. Run

Launch **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** from your Desktop.

---

## 🛠️ Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mcpv install` | Installs the gateway and creates the Desktop shortcut. |
| `mcpv install --force` | Forces installation even if only 1 MCP server exists. |
| `mcpv start` | Starts the server (Used internally by Antigravity). |
| `mcpv --help` | Show help message. |

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

#### Q. "File access denied" or "Failed to remove file" during update?

This means `mcpv.exe` or `Antigravity` is still running.

1. Close Antigravity.
2. Run: `Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force` in PowerShell.
3. Try installing again.

#### Q. I installed it, but I don't see the Shortcut.

The shortcut is created on your **Desktop**. If not, check the installation logs. You can create it manually by running `mcpv install` again.

## ❓ 为什么选择 `mcpv`？

在使用 AI 代理（Antigravity, Cursor）时，你是否有过这样的体验？
> *"为什么这么卡？"*  
> *"又卡死了..."*  
> *"为什么 Token 费用这么高？"*

`mcpv` 不仅仅是一个工具。它是你代理的 **涡轮引擎 (Turbo Engine)**。

<br>

### 🏎️ 压倒性的性能差异

| 功能 | 😫 没有 `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ 安装 `mcpv` (After) | 📈 效果 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **速度** | 无 GPU 加速，UI 卡顿 | **强制 GPU 加速，流畅** | **100倍** 体感提升 |
| **加载** | 每次等待 10秒+ | **0.1秒 瞬间启动** (Lazy Load) | **零** 等待 |
| **成本** | 每次发送全部代码 | **自动拦截重复项** (Smart Cache) | **90%** 节省 |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3大核心功能

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (物理加速)
**"一行命令解锁硬件限制"**
- **强制激活 GPU**: 注入隐藏的渲染加速标志 (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`)。
- **绕过权限问题**: 放弃管理员权限以修复拖放和 UI 错误，并使用 `RunAsInvoker` 绕过烦人的管理员权限请求 (Error 740)。
- **僵尸进程杀手**: 自动清理占用端口的幽灵进程。

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (成本防御)
**"为你省钱的智能钱包卫士"**
- 检测代理习惯性请求的巨大上下文数据 (`repomix`)。
- **首次请求：允许**（提供完整上下文）。
- **后续请求：拦截**（仅回复 10 Token 的 **“已缓存”** 消息）。
- 物理阻断意外的 Token 炸弹。

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (安全金库)
**"不再为复杂的配置烦恼"**
- **零延迟启动**：仅在代理实际请求时扫描目录。大代码库也不会超时。
- 自动将现有的复杂 MCP 设置迁移到安全的金库 (Vault)。
- 原始配置安全备份至 `mcp_config.original.json`。
- 代理只与 `mcpv` 对话，但所有工具在后台都能完美运行。

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ 호환성 주의 (Compatibility Warning)**<br>
> 현재 이 프로젝트는 **Windows** 운영체제와 **Antigravity (안티그래비티)** 에이전트 환경만 지원합니다.<br>
> _(Currently, this project ONLY supports **Windows** and **Antigravity**.)_

<br>

## ❓ 왜 `mcpv` 인가요?

AI 에이전트(Antigravity, Cursor)를 쓰다가 이런 경험 없으신가요?
> *"왜 이렇게 무겁지?"*  
> *"또 멈췄네..."*  
> *"토큰 비용이 왜 이렇게 많이 나와?"*

`mcpv`는 단순한 도구가 아닙니다. 당신의 에이전트를 위한 **터보 엔진**입니다.

<br>

### 🏎️ 압도적인 성능 차이

| 구분 | 😫 `mcpv` 없음 (Before) | ⚡ `mcpv` 장착 (After) | 📈 효과 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **속도** | GPU 미사용, UI 버벅임 | **GPU 강제 가속, 쾌적함** | **100배** 체감 향상 |
| **로딩** | 매번 수십 초 대기 | **0.1초 즉시 실행** (Lazy Load) | **대기시간 0초** |
| **비용** | 매번 전체 코드 전송 | **중복 자동 차단** (Smart Cache) | **90%** 절감 |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3가지 핵심 무기

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (물리적 가속)
**"명령어 한 줄로 하드웨어 봉인 해제"**
- **GPU 강제 활성화**: 숨겨진 렌더링 가속 플래그(`--enable-gpu-rasterization`)를 주입합니다.
- **권한 문제 해결**: 관리자 권한을 해제하여 드래그 앤 드롭 및 UI 버그를 수정하고, `RunAsInvoker`로 성가신 권한 요청(Error 740)을 우회합니다.
- **좀비 프로세스 킬**: 포트를 점유하는 유령 프로세스를 자동으로 청소합니다.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (비용 방어)
**"알아서 아껴주는 똑똑한 지갑 지킴이"**
- 에이전트가 습관적으로 요청하는 거대한 문맥 데이터(`repomix`)를 감지합니다.
- **첫 번째 요청: 허용** (전체 문맥 제공).
- **이후 요청: 차단** (10 토큰짜리 **"Already cached"** 메시지 반환).
- 실수로 인한 토큰 폭탄을 원천 봉쇄합니다.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (안전한 금고)
**"복잡한 설정은 이제 그만"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: 에이전트가 실제로 요청할 때만 디렉토리를 스캔합니다. 대규모 레포지토리에서도 타임아웃이 발생하지 않습니다.
- 기존의 복잡한 MCP 설정을 안전한 금고(Vault)로 자동 이전합니다.
- 원본 설정은 `mcp_config.original.json`에 안전하게 백업됩니다.
- 에이전트는 아무것도 모른 채 `mcpv`와 대화하지만, 모든 도구는 완벽하게 작동합니다.

      }
    }
  }
}
```


<br>

---

## 📝 권장 시스템 규칙 (Recommended System Rule)

**이 규칙을 에이전트의 시스템 프롬프트(.cursorrules, .antigravityrules 등)에 추가하세요.**  
에이전트가 중복 요청 없이 `mcpv`를 올바르게 사용하도록 보장합니다.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.
>
> **Context Management**: Do NOT call `get_initial_context` again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with `force=True`. The proxy will block redundant requests.
>
> **File Access**: After reading the initial context map, use `read_file` to inspect specific files needed for the task.

## ❓ Почему `mcpv`?

Вы когда-нибудь чувствовали это при использовании AI-агентов (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Почему так тяжело?"*  
> *"Опять зависло..."*  
> *"Почему расходы на токены такие высокие?"*

`mcpv` - это не просто инструмент. Это **Турбо-двигатель** для вашего агента.

<br>

### 🏎️ Ошеломляющая разница в производительности

| Функция | 😫 Без `mcpv` (До) | ⚡ С `mcpv` (После) | 📈 Эффект |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Скорость** | Нет GPU, Лагающий UI | **Принудительное ускорение GPU, Плавность** | **100x** Ощущаемая скорость |
| **Загрузка** | Ожидание 60с+ каждый раз | **0.1с Мгновенный старт** (Lazy Load) | **Ноль** Задержки |
| **Расходы** | Отправка полного кода каждый раз | **Авто-блокировка дубликатов** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Экономия |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3 ключевые функции

### 1️⃣ Инъекция ускорителя (Booster Injection - Физическое ускорение)
**"Снятие аппаратных ограничений одной строкой"**
- **Принудительная активация GPU**: Внедряет скрытые флаги ускорения рендеринга (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Обход прав доступа**: Сбрасывает права администратора для исправления багов drag-and-drop и UI, а также обходит запросы прав (Ошибка 740) с помощью `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Убийца зомби-процессов**: Автоматически очищает призрачные процессы, занимающие порты.

### 2️⃣ Умный клапан (Smart Valve - Защита расходов)
**"Умный защитник кошелька, который экономит за вас"**
- Обнаруживает массивные контекстные данные (`repomix`), которые агенты привыкли запрашивать.
- **Первый запрос: Разрешен** (Предоставляется полный контекст).
- **Последующие запросы: Заблокированы** сообщением **'Already cached'** (10 токенов).
- Физически блокирует случайные бомбы токенов.

### 3️⃣ Перехват шлюза (Gateway Hijacking - Безопасное хранилище)
**"Перестаньте мучиться со сложными настройками"**
- **Мгновенный запуск (Zero-Latency)**: Сканирует директории только когда агент их запрашивает. Нет таймаутов на больших репозиториях.
- Автоматически переносит существующие сложные настройки MCP в безопасное хранилище (Vault).
- Оригинальный конфиг безопасно сохраняется в `mcp_config.original.json`.
- Агент общается только с `mcpv`, но все инструменты прекрасно работают в фоновом режиме.

<br>

      }
    }
  }
}
```


<br>

---

## 📝 Рекомендуемое системное правило (Recommended System Rule)

**Добавьте это правило в системный промпт вашего агента (например, .cursorrules, .antigravityrules).**  
Это гарантирует, что агент будет использовать `mcpv` корректно без лишних запросов.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.

## 📦 Установка

Выберите метод, который подходит именно вам.

### Вариант A: Метод "Просто работает" (Рекомендуется для большинства)
Если у вас установлен Python и добавлен в PATH.

```powershell
# 1. Установка из PyPI
pip install mcpv

# 2. Настройка шлюза и ускорителя
mcpv install

# 3. Готово! 
# Ищите ярлык "Antigravity Boost (mcpv)" на рабочем столе.

```

---

### Вариант B: Метод "Надежный как скала" (С использованием `uv`)

Используйте этот метод, если ваше окружение Python загрязнено или вам нужна полная изоляция.

#### 1. Очистка существующих процессов

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

```

#### 2. Создание виртуального окружения и установка

```powershell
# Установка uv (если нужно)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Создание .venv и установка mcpv
uv venv
uv pip install mcpv

```

#### 3. Регистрация и блокировка

Это регистрирует **изолированное виртуальное окружение** в конфиге Antigravity.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force

```

#### 4. Запуск

Запустите **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** с вашего рабочего стола.

---

## 🛠️ Команды

| Команда | Описание |
| --- | --- |
| `mcpv install` | Устанавливает шлюз и создает ярлык на рабочем столе. |
| `mcpv install --force` | Принудительная установка, даже если существует только 1 MCP сервер. |
| `mcpv start` | Запускает сервер (Используется внутри Antigravity). |
| `mcpv --help` | Показать справку. |

---

## ❓ Устранение неполадок

#### Q. "File access denied" или "Failed to remove file" во время обновления?

Это означает, что `mcpv.exe` или `Antigravity` все еще запущены.

1. Закройте Antigravity.
2. Запустите: `Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force` в PowerShell.
3. Попробуйте установить снова.

#### Q. Я установил, но не вижу Ярлык.

Ярлык создается на вашем **Рабочем столе**. Если нет, проверьте логи установки. Вы можете создать его вручную, запустив `mcpv install` снова.

Hi everyone,
I've been using AI Agents (specifically Antigravity) heavily for coding, but I ran into three major frustrations that I think many of you might recognize:
Infinite Loading: Without GPU, Antigravity went too slow. In my case it went 58s unresponsive per 1 min. 
Context Bloat: The agent keeps requesting the full codebase context repeatedly whenever it loads MCP's, making my MCP servers unresponsive.
Agent/UI Lag: On Windows, the agent responses kept saying "Continue" repeatedly because of 1, 2.
I couldn't find a tool that solved all of this, so I built MCP Vault (mcpv).

🚀 What does it do?
It acts as a "Smart Middleware" between your Agent and your actual tools. It hijacks the mcp_config.json safely and optimizes the traffic.(All of MCPs will be kept exactly identically on C:\Users\[Username]\.gemini\antigravity\mcp_config.original.json)
1. Zero-Latency Startup (Lazy Loading) Instead of scanning files at boot, mcpv starts instantly (<0.1s). It only scans directories when the agent actually requests them. No timeouts on large repos.
2. Smart Context Valve It detects if the agent asks for a massive context dump (like a full repo summary) more than once in a session.
First request: Allowed (Full context provided).
Subsequent requests: Blocked with a "Context already cached" message (only ~20 tokens used). This physically prevents the agent from wasting tokens on duplicate data.
[System Instruction]


Session Start: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call get_initial_context tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.


Context Management: Do NOT call get_initial_context again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with force=True. The proxy will block redundant requests.


File Access: After reading the initial context map, use read_file to inspect specific files needed for the task.
This Antigravity rule needs to be added though.

3. Booster Injection (Windows/Antigravity) It auto-generates an optimized launcher script that:
Forces GPU rasterization & zero-copy flags.
Drops Admin rights (fixes drag-and-drop & UI bugs).
Kills zombie processes on port 26646 automatically.
The shortcut with injected script can be found on the desktop after installation.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python & uv: Uses uv for clean, isolated virtual environments to prevent dependency hell.
FastMCP: Built on top of the FastMCP framework for speed.
Gateway Pattern: It backs up your original config and routes traffic through the proxy securely.
📦 Installation
It's available on PyPI too.
Bash
pip install mcpv
mcpv install
Currently, it's optimized for Windows and Antigravity, but the core logic (Lazy Loading/Smart Valve) is applicable to any MCP-compliant agent.
I'd love to hear your feedback or feature requests!

## ❓ Почему `mcpv`?

Вы когда-нибудь чувствовали это при использовании AI-агентов (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Почему так тяжело?"*  
> *"Опять зависло..."*  
> *"Почему расходы на токены такие высокие?"*

`mcpv` - это не просто инструмент. Это **Турбо-двигатель** для вашего агента.

<br>

### 🏎️ Ошеломляющая разница в производительности

| Функция | 😫 Без `mcpv` (До) | ⚡ С `mcpv` (После) | 📈 Эффект |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Скорость** | Нет GPU, Лагающий UI | **Принудительное ускорение GPU, Плавность** | **100x** Ощущаемая скорость |
| **Загрузка** | Ожидание 60с+ каждый раз | **0.1с Мгновенный старт** (Lazy Load) | **Ноль** Задержки |
| **Расходы** | Отправка полного кода каждый раз | **Авто-блокировка дубликатов** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Экономия |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3 ключевые функции

### 1️⃣ Инъекция ускорителя (Booster Injection - Физическое ускорение)
**"Снятие аппаратных ограничений одной строкой"**
- **Принудительная активация GPU**: Внедряет скрытые флаги ускорения рендеринга (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Обход прав доступа**: Сбрасывает права администратора для исправления багов drag-and-drop и UI, а также обходит запросы прав (Ошибка 740) с помощью `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Убийца зомби-процессов**: Автоматически очищает призрачные процессы, занимающие порты.

### 2️⃣ Умный клапан (Smart Valve - Защита расходов)
**"Умный защитник кошелька, который экономит за вас"**
- Обнаруживает массивные контекстные данные (`repomix`), которые агенты привыкли запрашивать.
- **Первый запрос: Разрешен** (Предоставляется полный контекст).
- **Последующие запросы: Заблокированы** сообщением **'Already cached'** (10 токенов).
- Физически блокирует случайные бомбы токенов.

### 3️⃣ Перехват шлюза (Gateway Hijacking - Безопасное хранилище)
**"Перестаньте мучиться со сложными настройками"**
- **Мгновенный запуск (Zero-Latency)**: Сканирует директории только когда агент их запрашивает. Нет таймаутов на больших репозиториях.
- Автоматически переносит существующие сложные настройки MCP в безопасное хранилище (Vault).
- Оригинальный конфиг безопасно сохраняется в `mcp_config.original.json`.
- Агент общается только с `mcpv`, но все инструменты прекрасно работают в фоновом режиме.

## 📝 Рекомендуемое системное правило (Recommended System Rule)

**Добавьте это правило в системный промпт вашего агента (например, .cursorrules, .antigravityrules).**  
Это гарантирует, что агент будет использовать `mcpv` корректно без лишних запросов.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.

## 📦 Установка

Выберите метод, который подходит именно вам.

### Вариант A: Метод "Просто работает" (Рекомендуется для большинства)
Если у вас установлен Python и добавлен в PATH.

```powershell
# 1. Установка из PyPI
pip install mcpv

# 2. Настройка шлюза и ускорителя
mcpv install

# 3. Готово! 
# Ищите ярлык "Antigravity Boost (mcpv)" на рабочем столе.

```

---

### Вариант B: Метод "Надежный как скала" (С использованием `uv`)

Используйте этот метод, если ваше окружение Python загрязнено или вам нужна полная изоляция.

#### 1. Очистка существующих процессов

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

```

#### 2. Создание виртуального окружения и установка

```powershell
# Установка uv (если нужно)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Создание .venv и установка mcpv
uv venv
uv pip install mcpv

```

#### 3. Регистрация и блокировка

Это регистрирует **изолированное виртуальное окружение** в конфиге Antigravity.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force

```

#### 4. Запуск

Запустите **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** с вашего рабочего стола.

---

## 🛠️ Команды

| Команда | Описание |
| --- | --- |
| `mcpv install` | Устанавливает шлюз и создает ярлык на рабочем столе. |
| `mcpv install --force` | Принудительная установка, даже если существует только 1 MCP сервер. |
| `mcpv start` | Запускает сервер (Используется внутри Antigravity). |
| `mcpv --help` | Показать справку. |

---

## ❓ Устранение неполадок

#### Q. "File access denied" или "Failed to remove file" во время обновления?

Это означает, что `mcpv.exe` или `Antigravity` все еще запущены.

1. Закройте Antigravity.
2. Запустите: `Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force` в PowerShell.
3. Попробуйте установить снова.

#### Q. Я установил, но не вижу Ярлык.

Ярлык создается на вашем **Рабочем столе**. Если нет, проверьте логи установки. Вы можете создать его вручную, запустив `mcpv install` снова.

<br>

## ❓ 为什么选择 `mcpv`？

在使用 AI 代理（Antigravity, Cursor）时，你是否有过这样的体验？
> *"为什么这么卡？"*  
> *"又卡死了..."*  
> *"为什么 Token 费用这么高？"*

`mcpv` 不仅仅是一个工具。它是你代理的 **涡轮引擎 (Turbo Engine)**。

<br>

### 🏎️ 压倒性的性能差异

| 功能 | 😫 没有 `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ 安装 `mcpv` (After) | 📈 效果 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **速度** | 无 GPU 加速，UI 卡顿 | **强制 GPU 加速，流畅** | **100倍** 体感提升 |
| **加载** | 每次等待 10秒+ | **0.1秒 瞬间启动** (Lazy Load) | **零** 等待 |
| **成本** | 每次发送全部代码 | **自动拦截重复项** (Smart Cache) | **90%** 节省 |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3大核心功能

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (物理加速)
**"一行命令解锁硬件限制"**
- **强制激活 GPU**: 注入隐藏的渲染加速标志 (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`)。
- **绕过权限问题**: 放弃管理员权限以修复拖放和 UI 错误，并使用 `RunAsInvoker` 绕过烦人的管理员权限请求 (Error 740)。
- **僵尸进程杀手**: 自动清理占用端口的幽灵进程。

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (成本防御)
**"为你省钱的智能钱包卫士"**
- 检测代理习惯性请求的巨大上下文数据 (`repomix`)。
- **首次请求：允许**（提供完整上下文）。
- **后续请求：拦截**（仅回复 10 Token 的 **“已缓存”** 消息）。
- 物理阻断意外的 Token 炸弹。

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (安全金库)
**"不再为复杂的配置烦恼"**
- **零延迟启动**：仅在代理实际请求时扫描目录。大代码库也不会超时。
- 自动将现有的复杂 MCP 设置迁移到安全的金库 (Vault)。
- 原始配置安全备份至 `mcp_config.original.json`。
- 代理只与 `mcpv` 对话，但所有工具在后台都能完美运行。

## 📝 推荐系统规则 (Recommended System Rule)

**请将此规则添加到代理的系统提示词（如 .cursorrules, .antigravityrules）中。**  
这能确保代理正确使用 `mcpv` 而不会产生冗余请求。

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.
>
> **Context Management**: Do NOT call `get_initial_context` again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with `force=True`. The proxy will block redundant requests.
>
> **File Access**: After reading the initial context map, use `read_file` to inspect specific files needed for the task.

# 🚀 安装与运行指南 (Windows / 基于 uv)

建议使用 `uv` 在 **独立的虚拟环境 (.venv)** 中安装和运行本项目。

> ✅ 请在 **项目根目录**（此 README 所在位置）使用 **PowerShell** 执行以下操作。

---

## 0. 准备工作
- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell
- 已安装 `uv`
  - 检查安装：`uv --version`

---

## 1. 清理现有进程（可选）
如果是重新安装，请先停止任何正在运行的 `mcpv` 或 Python 进程以避免冲突。

> ⚠️ 停止 `python` 进程可能会影响其他正在进行的任务。请谨慎操作。

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

## 2. 创建虚拟环境并安装包
使用 `uv` 创建一个与系统 Python 隔离的干净环境。

```powershell
# 安装 uv (如果尚未安装)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# 创建虚拟环境 (.venv)
uv venv

# 在虚拟环境中安装 mcpv 包
uv pip install .
```

---

## 3. 注册 Antigravity 设置（核心步骤）
使用生成的虚拟环境中的 Python 来执行安装命令。

```powershell
# 使用 .venv 环境内的 Python 将 mcpv 注册到 Antigravity。
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force
```

---

## 4. 运行
双击桌面上生成的 **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** 快捷方式即可运行。

---

## (可选) 验证安装
检查 `mcpv` 模块是否在 `.venv` 中正常加载。

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv --help
```

## ❓ 왜 `mcpv` 인가요?

AI 에이전트(Antigravity, Cursor)를 쓰다가 이런 경험 없으신가요?
> *"왜 이렇게 무겁지?"*  
> *"또 멈췄네..."*  
> *"토큰 비용이 왜 이렇게 많이 나와?"*

`mcpv`는 단순한 도구가 아닙니다. 당신의 에이전트를 위한 **터보 엔진**입니다.

<br>

### 🏎️ 압도적인 성능 차이

| 구분 | 😫 `mcpv` 없음 (Before) | ⚡ `mcpv` 장착 (After) | 📈 효과 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **속도** | GPU 미사용, UI 버벅임 | **GPU 강제 가속, 쾌적함** | **100배** 체감 향상 |
| **로딩** | 매번 수십 초 대기 | **0.1초 즉시 실행** (Lazy Load) | **대기시간 0초** |
| **비용** | 매번 전체 코드 전송 | **중복 자동 차단** (Smart Cache) | **90%** 절감 |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3가지 핵심 무기

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (물리적 가속)
**"명령어 한 줄로 하드웨어 봉인 해제"**
- **GPU 강제 활성화**: 숨겨진 렌더링 가속 플래그(`--enable-gpu-rasterization`)를 주입합니다.
- **권한 문제 해결**: 관리자 권한을 해제하여 드래그 앤 드롭 및 UI 버그를 수정하고, `RunAsInvoker`로 성가신 권한 요청(Error 740)을 우회합니다.
- **좀비 프로세스 킬**: 포트를 점유하는 유령 프로세스를 자동으로 청소합니다.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (비용 방어)
**"알아서 아껴주는 똑똑한 지갑 지킴이"**
- 에이전트가 습관적으로 요청하는 거대한 문맥 데이터(`repomix`)를 감지합니다.
- **첫 번째 요청: 허용** (전체 문맥 제공).
- **이후 요청: 차단** (10 토큰짜리 **"Already cached"** 메시지 반환).
- 실수로 인한 토큰 폭탄을 원천 봉쇄합니다.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (안전한 금고)
**"복잡한 설정은 이제 그만"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: 에이전트가 실제로 요청할 때만 디렉토리를 스캔합니다. 대규모 레포지토리에서도 타임아웃이 발생하지 않습니다.
- 기존의 복잡한 MCP 설정을 안전한 금고(Vault)로 자동 이전합니다.
- 원본 설정은 `mcp_config.original.json`에 안전하게 백업됩니다.
- 에이전트는 아무것도 모른 채 `mcpv`와 대화하지만, 모든 도구는 완벽하게 작동합니다.

## 🛠️ 검증된 추천 세팅 (Verified Setup)

개발자가 직접 사용 중인 검증된 MCP 서버 구성입니다. `mcpv`와 함께 사용했을 때 최고의 시너지를 냅니다.

```json

      }
    }
  }
}
```


<br>

---

## 📝 권장 시스템 규칙 (Recommended System Rule)

**이 규칙을 에이전트의 시스템 프롬프트(.cursorrules, .antigravityrules 등)에 추가하세요.**  
에이전트가 중복 요청 없이 `mcpv`를 올바르게 사용하도록 보장합니다.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.
>
> **Context Management**: Do NOT call `get_initial_context` again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with `force=True`. The proxy will block redundant requests.
>
> **File Access**: After reading the initial context map, use `read_file` to inspect specific files needed for the task.

# 🚀 설치 및 실행 가이드 (Windows / uv 기준)

이 프로젝트는 `uv`를 사용하여 **독립적인 가상환경(.venv)** 에서 설치/실행하는 것을 권장합니다.

> ✅ 아래 명령은 **프로젝트 루트 폴더(README가 있는 위치)** 에서 PowerShell로 실행하세요.

---

## 0. 준비물
- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell
- `uv` 설치됨
  - 설치 확인: `uv --version`

---

## 1. 기존 프로세스 정리 (재설치 시)
기존에 실행 중인 프로세스가 있다면 충돌 방지를 위해 종료합니다.

> ⚠️ `python` 프로세스 종료는 다른 작업에도 영향을 줄 수 있으니, 필요할 때만 실행하세요.

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

## 2. 가상환경 생성 및 패키지 설치
`uv`를 이용해 시스템 파이썬과 분리된 깨끗한 환경을 만듭니다.

```powershell
# uv 설치
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# 가상환경(.venv) 생성
uv venv

# 가상환경에 mcpv 패키지 설치
uv pip install .
```

---

## 3. 안티그래비티 설정 등록 (핵심)
생성한 가상환경의 Python을 사용하여 설치 명령을 실행합니다.
즉, **이 가상환경을 사용하여 설치를 진행합니다.**

```powershell
# .venv 환경 내의 라이브러리를 사용하여 mcpv를 안티그래비티에 등록합니다.
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force
```

---

## 4. 실행
바탕화면에 생성된 **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** 바로가기를 더블 클릭하여 실행하세요.

---

## (선택) 정상 설치 확인
아래 명령으로 `.venv` 내부에서 `mcpv` 모듈이 정상적으로 로드되는지 확인할 수 있습니다.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv --help
```

---

## 🛠️ 명령어 (Commands)

| 명령어 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| `mcpv install` | 게이트웨이를 설치하고 바탕화면 바로가기를 생성합니다. |
| `mcpv install --force` | 기존 MCP 서버가 1개여도 강제로 설치를 진행합니다. |

## ❓ Why `mcpv`?

Have you ever felt this while using AI Agents (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Why is it so heavy?"*  
> *"It froze again..."*  
> *"Why are the token costs so high?"*

`mcpv` is not just a tool. It is a **Turbo Engine** for your agent.

<br>

### 🏎️ Overwhelming Performance Difference

| Feature | 😫 Without `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ With `mcpv` (After) | 📈 Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | No GPU, Laggy UI | **Forced GPU Acceleration, Smooth** | **100x** Perceived Speed |
| **Loading** | Wait 60s+ every time | **0.1s Instant Start** (Lazy Load) | **Zero** Latency |
| **Cost** | Resend full code every time | **Auto-block Duplicates** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Savings |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (Physical Acceleration)
**"Unlock hardware limits with one line"**
- **Forced GPU Activation**: Injects hidden rendering acceleration flags (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Permission Bypass**: Drops Admin rights to fix drag-and-drop & UI bugs, and bypasses permission requests (Error 740) using `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Zombie Process Killer**: Automatically cleans up ghost processes occupying ports.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (Cost Defense)
**"Smart wallet protector that saves for you"**
- Detects the massive context data (`repomix`) that agents habitually request.
- **First request: Allowed** (Full context provided).
- **Subsequent requests: Blocked** with a 10-token **"Already cached"** message.
- Physically blocks accidental token bombs.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (Secure Vault)
**"Stop struggling with complex configs"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: Only scans directories when the agent actually requests them. No timeouts on large repos.
- Automatically migrates existing complex MCP settings to a secure Vault.
- Original config is safely backed up to `mcp_config.original.json`.
- The agent talks only to `mcpv`, but all tools work perfectly behind the scenes.

## 🛠️ Verified Recommended Setup

Verified MCP server configuration used by the developer. It creates the best synergy when used with `mcpv`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rube": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://rube.app/mcp"]
    },
    "open-aware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://open-aware.qodo.ai/mcp"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "PUT_IN_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "mcp-server-neon": {
      "disabled": false,
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"],
      "env": {
        "NEON_API_KEY": "NEVERCHANGE_DONT_PUT_IN_ANYTHING_ELSE_THAN_ME_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<br>

---

## � Recommended System Rule

**Add this rule to your agent's system prompt (e.g., .cursorrules, .antigravityrules).**  
This ensures the agent uses `mcpv` correctly without redundant requests.

> **[System Instruction]**
>
> **Session Start**: At the very beginning of the conversation, you MUST call `get_initial_context` tool immediately. This is your only way to understand the project structure.
>
> **Context Management**: Do NOT call `get_initial_context` again in the same session unless the user explicitly asks for a "refresh" with `force=True`. The proxy will block redundant requests.
>
> **File Access**: After reading the initial context map, use `read_file` to inspect specific files needed for the task.

<br>

---

## �🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python & uv**: Uses `uv` for clean, isolated virtual environments to prevent dependency hell.
- **FastMCP**: Built on top of the FastMCP framework for speed.
- **Gateway Pattern**: It backs up your original config and routes traffic through the proxy securely.

<br>

---

## 📦 Installation

Choose the method that fits your needs.

### Option A: The "It Just Works" Method (Recommended for most users)
If you have Python installed and added to PATH.

```powershell
# 1. Install from PyPI
pip install mcpv

# 2. Setup Gateway & Booster
mcpv install

# 3. Done! 
# Look for the "Antigravity Boost (mcpv)" shortcut on your Desktop.

```

---

### Option B: The "Rock-Solid" Method (Using `uv`)

Use this method if your Python environment is messy or you want complete isolation.

#### 1. Clean up existing processes

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "python" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install

```powershell
# Install uv (if needed)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm [https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1](https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1) | iex"

# Create .venv and install mcpv
uv venv
uv pip install mcpv

```

#### 3. Register & Lock

This registers the **isolated virtual environment** into Antigravity's config.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m mcpv install --force

```

#### 4. Run

Launch **`Antigravity Boost (mcpv)`** from your Desktop.

---

## 🛠️ Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mcpv install` | Installs the gateway and creates the Desktop shortcut. |
| `mcpv install --force` | Forces installation even if only 1 MCP server exists. |
| `mcpv start` | Starts the server (Used internally by Antigravity). |
| `mcpv --help` | Show help message. |

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

#### Q. "File access denied" or "Failed to remove file" during update?

This means `mcpv.exe` or `Antigravity` is still running.

1. Close Antigravity.
2. Run: `Stop-Process -Name "mcpv" -Force` in PowerShell.
3. Try installing again.

#### Q. I installed it, but I don't see the Shortcut.

The shortcut is created on your **Desktop**. If not, check the installation logs. You can create it manually by running `mcpv install` again.

## ❓ Почему `mcpv`?

Вы когда-нибудь чувствовали это при использовании AI-агентов (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Почему так тяжело?"*  
> *"Опять зависло..."*  
> *"Почему расходы на токены такие высокие?"*

`mcpv` - это не просто инструмент. Это **Турбо-двигатель** для вашего агента.

<br>

### 🏎️ Ошеломляющая разница в производительности

| Функция | 😫 Без `mcpv` (До) | ⚡ С `mcpv` (После) | 📈 Эффект |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Скорость** | Нет GPU, Лагающий UI | **Принудительное ускорение GPU, Плавность** | **100x** Ощущаемая скорость |
| **Загрузка** | Ожидание 60с+ каждый раз | **0.1с Мгновенный старт** (Lazy Load) | **Ноль** Задержки |
| **Расходы** | Отправка полного кода каждый раз | **Авто-блокировка дубликатов** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Экономия |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3 ключевые функции

### 1️⃣ Инъекция ускорителя (Booster Injection - Физическое ускорение)
**"Снятие аппаратных ограничений одной строкой"**
- **Принудительная активация GPU**: Внедряет скрытые флаги ускорения рендеринга (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Обход прав доступа**: Сбрасывает права администратора для исправления багов drag-and-drop и UI, а также обходит запросы прав (Ошибка 740) с помощью `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Убийца зомби-процессов**: Автоматически очищает призрачные процессы, занимающие порты.

### 2️⃣ Умный клапан (Smart Valve - Защита расходов)
**"Умный защитник кошелька, который экономит за вас"**
- Обнаруживает массивные контекстные данные (`repomix`), которые агенты привыкли запрашивать.
- **Первый запрос: Разрешен** (Предоставляется полный контекст).
- **Последующие запросы: Заблокированы** сообщением **'Already cached'** (10 токенов).
- Физически блокирует случайные бомбы токенов.

### 3️⃣ Перехват шлюза (Gateway Hijacking - Безопасное хранилище)
**"Перестаньте мучиться со сложными настройками"**
- **Мгновенный запуск (Zero-Latency)**: Сканирует директории только когда агент их запрашивает. Нет таймаутов на больших репозиториях.
- Автоматически переносит существующие сложные настройки MCP в безопасное хранилище (Vault).
- Оригинальный конфиг безопасно сохраняется в `mcp_config.original.json`.
- Агент общается только с `mcpv`, но все инструменты прекрасно работают в фоновом режиме.

## ❓ 为什么选择 `mcpv`？

在使用 AI 代理（Antigravity, Cursor）时，你是否有过这样的体验？
> *"为什么这么卡？"*  
> *"又卡死了..."*  
> *"为什么 Token 费用这么高？"*

`mcpv` 不仅仅是一个工具。它是你代理的 **涡轮引擎 (Turbo Engine)**。

<br>

### 🏎️ 压倒性的性能差异

| 功能 | 😫 没有 `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ 安装 `mcpv` (After) | 📈 效果 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **速度** | 无 GPU 加速，UI 卡顿 | **强制 GPU 加速，流畅** | **100倍** 体感提升 |
| **加载** | 每次等待 10秒+ | **0.1秒 瞬间启动** (Lazy Load) | **零** 等待 |
| **成本** | 每次发送全部代码 | **自动拦截重复项** (Smart Cache) | **90%** 节省 |

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (物理加速)
**"一行命令解锁硬件限制"**
- **强制激活 GPU**: 注入隐藏的渲染加速标志 (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`)。
- **绕过权限问题**: 放弃管理员权限以修复拖放和 UI 错误，并使用 `RunAsInvoker` 绕过烦人的管理员权限请求 (Error 740)。
- **僵尸进程杀手**: 自动清理占用端口的幽灵进程。

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (成本防御)
**"为你省钱的智能钱包卫士"**
- 检测代理习惯性请求的巨大上下文数据 (`repomix`)。
- **首次请求：允许**（提供完整上下文）。
- **后续请求：拦截**（仅回复 10 Token 的 **“已缓存”** 消息）。
- 物理阻断意外的 Token 炸弹。

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (安全金库)
**"不再为复杂的配置烦恼"**
- **零延迟启动**：仅在代理实际请求时扫描目录。大代码库也不会超时。
- 自动将现有的复杂 MCP 设置迁移到安全的金库 (Vault)。
- 原始配置安全备份至 `mcp_config.original.json`。
- 代理只与 `mcpv` 对话，但所有工具在后台都能完美运行。

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ 호환성 주의 (Compatibility Warning)**<br>
> 현재 이 프로젝트는 **Windows** 운영체제와 **Antigravity (안티그래비티)** 에이전트 환경만 지원합니다.<br>

<br>

## ❓ 왜 `mcpv` 인가요?

AI 에이전트(Antigravity, Cursor)를 쓰다가 이런 경험 없으신가요?
> *"왜 이렇게 무겁지?"*  
> *"또 멈췄네..."*  
> *"토큰 비용이 왜 이렇게 많이 나와?"*

`mcpv`는 단순한 도구가 아닙니다. 당신의 에이전트를 위한 **터보 엔진**입니다.

<br>

### 🏎️ 압도적인 성능 차이

| 구분 | 😫 `mcpv` 없음 (Before) | ⚡ `mcpv` 장착 (After) | 📈 효과 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **속도** | GPU 미사용, UI 버벅임 | **GPU 강제 가속, 쾌적함** | **100배** 체감 향상 |
| **로딩** | 매번 수십 초 대기 | **0.1초 즉시 실행** (Lazy Load) | **대기시간 0초** |
| **비용** | 매번 전체 코드 전송 | **중복 자동 차단** (Smart Cache) | **90%** 절감 |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3가지 핵심 무기

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (물리적 가속)
**"명령어 한 줄로 하드웨어 봉인 해제"**
- **GPU 강제 활성화**: 숨겨진 렌더링 가속 플래그(`--enable-gpu-rasterization`)를 주입합니다.
- **권한 문제 해결**: 관리자 권한을 해제하여 드래그 앤 드롭 및 UI 버그를 수정하고, `RunAsInvoker`로 성가신 권한 요청(Error 740)을 우회합니다.
- **좀비 프로세스 킬**: 포트를 점유하는 유령 프로세스를 자동으로 청소합니다.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (비용 방어)
**"알아서 아껴주는 똑똑한 지갑 지킴이"**
- 에이전트가 습관적으로 요청하는 거대한 문맥 데이터(`repomix`)를 감지합니다.
- **첫 번째 요청: 허용** (전체 문맥 제공).
- **이후 요청: 차단** (10 토큰짜리 **"Already cached"** 메시지 반환).
- 실수로 인한 토큰 폭탄을 원천 봉쇄합니다.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (안전한 금고)
**"복잡한 설정은 이제 그만"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: 에이전트가 실제로 요청할 때만 디렉토리를 스캔합니다. 대규모 레포지토리에서도 타임아웃이 발생하지 않습니다.
- 기존의 복잡한 MCP 설정을 안전한 금고(Vault)로 자동 이전합니다.
- 원본 설정은 `mcp_config.original.json`에 안전하게 백업됩니다.
- 에이전트는 아무것도 모른 채 `mcpv`와 대화하지만, 모든 도구는 완벽하게 작동합니다.

## ❓ Why `mcpv`?

Have you ever felt this while using AI Agents (Antigravity, Cursor)?
> *"Why is it so heavy?"*  
> *"It froze again..."*  
> *"Why are the token costs so high?"*

`mcpv` is not just a tool. It is a **Turbo Engine** for your agent.

<br>

### 🏎️ Overwhelming Performance Difference

| Feature | 😫 Without `mcpv` (Before) | ⚡ With `mcpv` (After) | 📈 Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | No GPU, Laggy UI | **Forced GPU Acceleration, Smooth** | **100x** Perceived Speed |
| **Loading** | Wait 60s+ every time | **0.1s Instant Start** (Lazy Load) | **Zero** Latency |
| **Cost** | Resend full code every time | **Auto-block Duplicates** (Smart Cache) | **90%** Savings |

<br>

---

## ✨ 3 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Booster Injection (Physical Acceleration)
**"Unlock hardware limits with one line"**
- **Forced GPU Activation**: Injects hidden rendering acceleration flags (`--enable-gpu-rasterization`).
- **Permission Bypass**: Drops Admin rights to fix drag-and-drop & UI bugs, and bypasses permission requests (Error 740) using `RunAsInvoker`.
- **Zombie Process Killer**: Automatically cleans up ghost processes occupying ports.

### 2️⃣ Smart Valve (Cost Defense)
**"Smart wallet protector that saves for you"**
- Detects the massive context data (`repomix`) that agents habitually request.
- **First request: Allowed** (Full context provided).
- **Subsequent requests: Blocked** with a 10-token **"Already cached"** message.
- Physically blocks accidental token bombs.

### 3️⃣ Gateway Hijacking (Secure Vault)
**"Stop struggling with complex configs"**
- **Zero-Latency Startup**: Only scans directories when the agent actually requests them. No timeouts on large repos.
- Automatically migrates existing complex MCP settings to a secure Vault.
- Original config is safely backed up to `mcp_config.original.json`.
- The agent talks only to `mcpv`, but all tools work perfectly behind the scenes.
